This work, "The AI-Powered Height-Adjustable Desk Based on Large Language Models," pioneers the integration of AI technology into traditional desks, establishing an intelligent learning and office ecosystem. The system integrates three core modules: multimodal interaction (voice/touch), environmental sensing (lighting/temperature/humidity), and health management (posture correction/height adjustment). It utilizes a large language model to enable natural interaction and intelligent decision-making.

Powered by the Infineon PSoC6 Competition Kit to coordinate the sensor network and actuators, its innovative three-dimensional interaction framework (Environment-User-Task) dynamically optimizes lighting and desk configurations based on contextual demands. It further constructs personalized knowledge graphs to enable adaptive learning. Targeting diverse sectors including education, office environments, and creative industries, the product redefines human-machine collaboration in smart workspaces. Through its health-focused closed-loop system (monitoring-reminding-adjustment) and intelligent task management, it delivers an innovative experience prioritizing both efficiency and well-being.
